Hey there! I'm Abd-Elrahman, a passionate .NET developer and Cairo University Computer Science graduate (2021). My journey in tech started through competitive programming, where I honed strong problem-solving skills and became a 2x ECPC finalist (2018, 2020).

After completing military service in 2022 (where I built full-stack applications with C# and ASP.NET MVC), I transitioned into professional development — first at Premium Card as a Junior Backend Developer, then at EFG Holding as a Software Engineer.

Today, I specialize in building scalable backend systems, WPF desktop apps, and full-stack web solutions using .NET, Angular, and modern architectural patterns like Clean Architecture and CQRS. I enjoy working in Agile teams, brainstorming product ideas, and delivering clean, maintainable software that solves real problems.
